## Challenge 1:
Simply print the contents of the text file to the screen.

## Challenge 2:
Add the names of everyone in your group to the end of the text file.

Create a new folder within the challenge4 folder called "copyfolder". Then copy info.txt into that folder.

## Challenge 5:
Replace all of the "-"'s inside the text file with spaces.

## Challenge 6:
Display all files that end with ".txt". Don't hard code the file names!
